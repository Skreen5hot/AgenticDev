# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## v2.1.0 — System agents, applier, required-keys CPS, test suite

Additive release. The "hit run, walk away" pipeline now lands: a developer agent's `changes[]` proposals can be executed by a deterministic system agent.

### Added
- **System agent infrastructure.** `SYSTEM_AGENTS` registry + `invoke_agent` dispatcher in the daemon. System agents are deterministic Python functions that run locally (no LLM). Worker agents (LLM) and system agents (Python) share the same task contract.
- **`applier` system agent.** Consumes a developer agent's `changes[]` and writes them to disk with strict before-snippet matching (each `before` must appear exactly once; ambiguous or missing → CPS veto). Documented at `.claude/agents/applier.md`.
- **Required-keys CPS validation.** Each agent's frontmatter declares `required_outputs: [keys]`. The daemon parses it on dispatch; CPS vetoes any successful output missing a required key.
- **`tests/` directory** with stdlib `unittest` coverage (62 tests) across routing, extractor, CPS, audit, upstream, reconciliation, daemon lock, and applier. Run via `python -m unittest discover tests`.

### Changed
- All 7 worker agents now declare `required_outputs:` in frontmatter.
- `cps_check` signature now reads the agent's required-keys list from frontmatter via a new `_agent_required_outputs` helper.
- `developer` agent body updated to reference the `applier` by name (no longer "an apply step not yet built").
- CLAUDE.md restructured agent roster into Worker / System sections; flow step 4 now documents `invoke_agent` dispatcher.
- README documents the apply step pattern with a queueable example task and adds a Testing section.

### Migration notes
Drop-in compatible with v2.0.0 task queues. Existing state.jsonld files continue to work — the new `required_outputs` check only activates if the agent's frontmatter declares one.

## v2.0.0 — Barcode Orchestrator

**Major refactor.** Barcode is now a deterministic Python multi-agent orchestrator for Claude Code subagents, not a TypeScript JSON-LD service scaffold.

### Added
- `fnsr_daemon.py` — single-file Python stdlib orchestrator
- `state.jsonld` — JSON-LD work queue with SHA-256 hash chain audit trail
- `.claude/agents/` — seven worker agents (spec-reviewer, adversarial-critic, synthesist, architect, developer, semantic-sme, ux-sme)
- CPS containment hook, crash recovery, daemon-side upstream injection
- SPL v0.1: priority-based task routing
- `--agent <name>` invocation pattern with tolerant output extractor

### Removed
- TypeScript kernel scaffold (`src/`, `tests/`, `dist/`, `package.json`, etc.)
- Old layer-based architecture docs (`docs/`)
- npm-based CI workflow

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` rewritten as orchestrator-centric system directives
- `README.md` rewritten as Barcode template instantiation guide
- `.gitignore` slimmed to language-agnostic

### Migration notes
This is a breaking change. Existing clones based on the TS scaffold should treat this as a new template — there is no migration path from v1.x. The `./project/` convention is preserved; subject project docs (SPEC.md, ROADMAP.md, DECISIONS.md) live there as before.
